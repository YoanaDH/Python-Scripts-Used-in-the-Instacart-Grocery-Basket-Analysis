# Python-Scripts-Used-in-the-Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but would like to uncover more information about their sales patterns. **The purpose of this project is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of Instacart's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.**

The variety of customers and their purchasing behaviors in the database is the most interesting topic for the main Instacart stakeholders who believe they could not target everyone using the same methods and strategy. They believe that targeting different customers with applicable marketing campaigns would have a positive effect on the sale of their products. 

**My analysis will mainly provide insights regarding how this strategy might look like and will aim to answer the following key questions:**
-  The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
-  The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
-  They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
-  Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use a simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
-  Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
-  The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
    - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
    - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
    - What differences can we find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Considering the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, etc.
